## tl;dr version 
 
Once you have _established_ that you have definitely lost your wallet or whatever containing the `Aufentshaltstitle` or the residence permit, do the following:

* Register a complaint at the _Fundbüro_ (lost and found) of the city council and/or the place you likely lost your card at (maybe in the university campus or a cafeteria, etc.). The registration complaint at the Fundbüro of the city can also be done online. There is a very high likelihood that it might be found/given there if the city/town you lost it in is small or a student town. 

* Next, to re-apply for the residence permit you need to go a Police station and file a complaint and get a document known as _Verlustanzeige_, which officially states that you have lost your card at a certain place and time. To do this, take along with you your passport and student ID (if a student) and a German speaking friend if your German is inadequate. 

* Send this _Verlustanzeige_ by email to your person-in-charge at the _Ausländerbehörde_ (foreigner's office that issued you your Residence Permit in the first place) and explain in detail. 

* Then, they will issue a temporary residence permit _Aufenthaltsfiktion_, which gives you the legal rights to stay, and then you go over the process of re-applying for your residence permit as before (you will again have to pay for the new permit). 

* Also take note of any other cards that were lost in this process (if it was a wallet that was lost), cancel all the bank cards and inform the health insurance and the usual. 

> All of this is ONLY based on my personal experience and was valid in 2020, I do not hold any responsibility for this being future-proof or working in your situation. I would first write to the _Ausländerbehörde_ to be sure of what to do.
